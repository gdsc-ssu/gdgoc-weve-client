## 🌟 Introduction
Weave is an app where wise seniors help solve the concerns of young people.    


## 🎯 Purpose
Our team is driven by a desire to solve one of society’s most pressing yet overlooked issues: loneliness in old age.   



## 🧩 Problem Solving
We address the growing issue of social isolation among the elderly.
By connecting seniors with younger generations, we reduce loneliness and mental health risks.
Our solution empowers seniors to contribute their life experience in meaningful ways.  



## 🌏 UN SDGs

This app aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically:

**Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure**

**Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities**
