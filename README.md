## 🌟 Introduction
Weave is an app where wise seniors help solve the concerns of young people.  


## 🎯 Purpose
Our app not only helps young people with their concerns, but also provides seniors with meaningful roles, helping address the “Three Highs” of aging (high loneliness, high depression, high suicide rate) and instilling a sense of purpose.

This app aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically:

Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure

Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities
